# heatpumps

Steady-state simulation of design and partload operation of a wide collection of heat pump topologies.

## Key Features

  - Steady-state simulation of design and partload operation based on [TESPy](https://github.com/oemof/tespy)
  - Parametrisation and result visualisation through a [StreamLit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) dashboard
  - Industry standard, as well as topologies still in research and developement, supported
  - Sub- and transcritical processes
  - Wide variety of refrigerant due to the integration of [CoolProp](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp)

## Installation

For now, only direct download from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jfreissmann/heatpumps) is supported.
