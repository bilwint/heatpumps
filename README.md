# heatpumps

Steady-state simulation of design and partload operation of a wide collection of heat pump topologies.

## Key Features

  - Steady-state simulation of design and partload operation based on [TESPy](https://github.com/oemof/tespy)
  - Parametrization and result visualisation through a [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) dashboard
  - Industry standard, as well as topologies still in research and developement, supported
  - Sub- and transcritical processes
  - Wide variety of refrigerants due to the integration of [CoolProp](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp)

## Installation

For now, only direct download from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jfreissmann/heatpumps) is supported, so just clone it locally or download a ZIP file of the code. To use the heat pump model classes or visualization dashboard, the necessary dependencies have to be installed from the `requirements.txt` file. In a clean environment from the root directory the installation from this file could look like this:

```
conda create -n my_new_env python=3.11
```

```
conda activate my_new_env
```

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the dashboard

Running the heat pump dashboard is as easy as running the following command from the root directory in your virtual environment with dependencies installed:

```
streamlit run src\heatpumps\hp_dashboard.py
```
